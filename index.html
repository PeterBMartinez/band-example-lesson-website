          Blink-182[note 1] (often stylized in all lowercase as blink-182) is an
          American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015,
          the lineup of the band has consisted of bass guitarist and vocalist
          Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt
          Skiba. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and
          drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California
          punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for
          high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Bassist
          Mark Hoppus is the only constant band member.

          In its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut,
          Cheshire Cat (1995). The group signed with major label MCA Records to
          co-distribute its second album, Dude Ranch (1997). Raynor was fired
          midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next
          two releases, Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and
          Jacket (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and
          MTV airplay. Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift
          for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was
          termed an "indefinite hiatus". They reunited in 2009, producing the
          trio's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again
          exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, with
          their resulting seventh studio album, California, being released on
          July 1, 2016. Their most recent effort titled Nine, was released on
          September 20, 2019.

          The album debuted at number one in the US and several other countries,
          and was the group's first domestic chart-topper in 15 years, and first
          ever in the UK. It received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album;
          the band's first. Its first two singles, "Bored to Death" and "She's
          Out of Her Mind", charted well on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.
          California received mixed reviews from music critics, with some
          praising the band's return to their classic sound and others
          criticizing the length of the album as well as Feldmann's input and
          production. The band supported the album with a large headlining tour
          in North America and Europe. A deluxe edition of the album, containing
          eleven new songs, was released in May 2017.
